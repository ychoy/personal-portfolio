    About Me

<p> Hi, I'm Yan Yin Choy! This is my developer portfolio where I share all of my favorite work.

<p>
I am learning programming to create technology for 21st century government. I was inspired by my previous work and leadership roles, where I managed public-private partnerships to innovate local government services, facilitated inter-agency leadership on open data policy with the State of California, and volunteered with Code for San José to advocate for the successful passage of open data policy in San José. I am currently learning how to build web applications with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby. Over the past eight years, I have designed and managed organizations and programs at the local and state level to cultivate leadership, scale community partnerships and improve operational efficiency. I am seeking opportunities to leverage my cross-functional, organizational management, and problem-solving skills to spark civic innovation and create civic tech.
</p>

<p>
As a self-starter, I am committed to deepening civic engagement and sparking civic innovation. I serve as Co-Director of the New Leaders Council Silicon Valley, where I cultivate diverse young leaders from public and private sectors to gain skills and build community to turn their passion into impact. I recruited and graduated 23 NLC Fellows, designed leadership curriculum and recruited speakers.  As Operations Manager for Silicon Valley Talent Partnership, I created and managed public-private partnerships to innovate government services within the City of San José and recruited and managed the internship program. In 2013, I served as an Executive Fellow with the California Governor's Office of Planning and Research, where I recruited and managed 21 interns, analyzed policy on land use planning, and facilitated inter-agency collaboration on open data policy. In 2015, I earned the Lee Sturtevant Woman Warrior Award and in 2012 the César E. Chávez Memorial Education Award.
</p>

<p> I graduated from San José State University with a Bachelors in Environmental Studies in 2012. While studying at SJSU, I advocated and fostered student engagement, focusing on policies and community programs to improve public safety, academic affairs, public health, and sustainability as the A.S. Director of Student Rights and Responsibilities during the 2011-2012 academic year.
